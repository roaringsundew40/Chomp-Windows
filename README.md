# Chomp-Windows
The Chomp Game shown on my Website at www.namankhurana.org
Chomp is a two-player strategy game played on a rectangular grid made up of smaller square cells, which can be thought of as the blocks of a chocolate bar. The players take it in turns to choose one block and "eat it" (remove from the board), together with those that are below it and to its right. The top left block is "poisoned" and the player who eats this loses. Read the rules from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomp.
